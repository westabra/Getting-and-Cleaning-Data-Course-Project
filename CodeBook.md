The Rscript named "Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.R", it commented highly, self-explanatory and detailed overview of what it done, step by step: 
 i) Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
step 1: download zip file from website
step 2: unzip data
step 3: load data into R
step 4: merge train and test data
 ii) Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
step 1: load feature name into R
step 2:  extract mean and standard deviation of each measurements
 iii) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 step 1: load activity data into R
 step 2: replace 1 to 6 with activity names
  iv) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  v) From the data set in step iv, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    Creates a file named "MeanData.txt". You find this data set  in this repo.
